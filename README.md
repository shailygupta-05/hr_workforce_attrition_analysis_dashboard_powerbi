This project analyzes an HR employee dataset using Microsoft Power BI to convert workforce data into meaningful business insights.
 
Three interactive dashboards were created:

- **Executive Overview Dashboard**  
- **Demographics & Reasons Analysis Dashboard**

#  BUSINESS INSIGHTS & KEY FINDINGS

##  WORKFORCE OVERVIEW
 A 33% attrition rate indicates a serious turnover issue requiring immediate HR focus.

## ATTRITION BY DEPARTMENT
 Production Department and Software Engineering – 
 These departments show the highest risk and need targeted retention strategies.

## RECRUITMENT SOURCE IMPACT

Terminated employees by source:
Google Search and Indeed generate the highest exits, suggesting possible hiring quality issues.

## PERFORMANCE VS ATTRITION

- Majority of employees who left were rated “Fully Meets Expectations”  
- Very few exits from “Exceeds Expectations”

 Attrition is not mainly performance-driven; workplace satisfaction and compensation are bigger factors.

## DEMOGRAPHIC INSIGHTS

- Workforce is 56.59% female and 43.41% male, showing a balanced gender mix  
- Majority employees are Single (44%) and Married (40%), indicating a relatively young workforce  
- Racial composition is mainly White (60%), followed by Black/African American (25%) and Asian (9%)

 Overall, demographic factors do not strongly drive attrition; exits are more related to job satisfaction, growth opportunities, and workplace conditions.

## TERMINATION REASONS
Major reasons for leaving:
- Unhappiness  
- Career Change  
- More Money  
- Work Hours  

 Most exits relate to compensation, work-life balance, and career growth concerns.
