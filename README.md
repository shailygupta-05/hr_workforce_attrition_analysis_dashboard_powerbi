##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an HR employee dataset using Microsoft Power BI.  
The main goal was to transform HR raw data into meaningful insights related to:

- Workforce distribution  
- Employee attrition  
- Recruitment effectiveness  
- Performance and termination trends  

Three interactive dashboards were created:

- Executive Overview Dashboard  
- Demographics & Reasons Analysis Dashboard  
- Employee Details Dashboard  

These dashboards help HR professionals monitor employee behavior, identify high-risk areas, and take data-driven HR decisions.

---

##  Problem Statement

Organizations often struggle to understand:

- Why employees are leaving  
- Which departments face high attrition  
- Which recruitment sources are effective  
- Whether performance impacts attrition  
- How demographic factors affect workforce stability  

Without proper analysis, HR teams cannot take proactive actions to improve retention.

This project aims to solve these problems by building structured and interactive Power BI dashboards to support strategic HR decision-making.

##  Business Insights & Key Findings

### Workforce Overview

- Total workforce consists of 311 employees  
- Out of them 104 employees have left  
- Overall attrition rate is 33%  
- 207 employees remain active  

This indicates a significant turnover issue that requires HR attention.

---

### Attrition by Department

- Production department has the highest attrition rate – 40%  
- Software Engineering follows with 36% attrition  

Production and Software Engineering teams need immediate retention focus.

---

### Recruitment Source Impact

Terminated employees by recruitment source:

- Google Search – 30 employees  
- Indeed – 21 employees  

Google Search and Indeed contribute to the highest number of exits, indicating possible hiring quality issues.

---

### Performance vs Attrition

- Majority of employees who left were in the “Fully Meets Expectations” category  
- Very few left from the “Exceeds Expectations” category  

Attrition is not purely performance-driven; other factors such as job satisfaction and compensation may be influencing exits.
